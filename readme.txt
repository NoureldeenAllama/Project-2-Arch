Project Status:

We have built an architectural simulator capable of assesing performance in an out-of-order 16-Bit RISC processor that uses Tomasulo's Algorithm without speculation. We assumed the a simplified computer (RISC-16) with 16-Bit word size and 8 Regs to be our model. We also took the values of the reservation stations and needed clock cycles for execution for each instruction from the main doc file. For conditional Branches, the processor always uses not taken predictor.

Due to some unfortunte events (One of our laptops with our work crashed) we ended up writing two code. The one named Tomasulo is the main code, but it has some minor things missing. The one called console app is the other code, where we added some of the missing things that worked but isn't our main code.
